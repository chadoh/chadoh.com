# Good Coders are Lazy

I have very little desire to make my own website, nor do I have
time. Here comes Posterous to my rescue. I don't feel guilty or
lazy, I feel (de)light(ed).

**Update** (<time>2011-06-02</time>): This is old news. I am now
building my blog with [Nesta][1], which was inspired by a [post from
Peep Code][2].
