# Dear Internet: Please make these things

If I had infinite time, I would work on these things because
they'd be sha-weeet. But I have finite time. So maybe you can make them
exist for me? (I would totally be a contributor on [Github][1].) They're kind
of art pieces that have arguably little utility but would be fun, simple
projects that would look great in a portfolio.

In Chapter 7 of [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby][4], Blixy the cat
demonstrates a program that turns text upside-down (about 1/4 of the way
down, right after the giant rabbit-thing). There are already websites
that turn text upside-down, but not in as a charmingly low-tech way. I'd
like to see a very simple web app with a focus on good, [Why-inspired
design][5] and clean URLs. Maybe add a little bit to Blixy's version of the
program (like, maybe swap '?' and 'Â¿' and those sorts of things), but
don't invert everything like [these ad-ridden over-achievers][6].

## Nonlinear Conversation  
_difficulty: 1 month  
probable technologies: [a fancy db][7], [Node.js][8], [Spine.js][9], [Jasmine][10]_

It occurs to me, you know, that conversation is only one dimensional
because of a limitation of the medium. Air waves travel from me to you,
you ingest them, you send some back to me. What if we could hear and
speak in two dimensions? Our conversations could flow out in multiple
directions, branches overlapping, make tapestries.

So basically, I think it'd be really neat to have an IM client that by
default was one dimensional, all new replies just piled on the stack.
But I have the ability to drag the replies around, reorder them, make
their visual representation more accurately match the thought-flow. Make
one node branch out into two or more new ones. IMs are so perfectly
suited to this.

Have you ever had a split in an IM conversation, when you end up
discussing two things at once? That's an obvious use-case. When either
(or any) of the participants relocate a node, both see it.

This could be a really beautiful, interesting examination of how the
brain organizes thoughts. Do shy away, though, from adding extra and
silly features, like customizable colors & shapes or anything like that.

## A Suggestion Service for Music Suggestion Services
_difficulty: 1 month  
probable technologies: [a database][11], [Rails][12], [Heroku][13] and optionally lots of
JavaScript in the form of a Chrome extension_

Oh, let's see: [iTunes][14], [Google Music][15], [Pandora][16],
[Spotify][17], [Rdio][18], [SoundCloud][19], [Noise Trade][20],
[ReverbNation][21], [Moog Music][22], [GrooveShark][23],
[thesixtyone][24], [Last.fm][25], [MySpace][26], [Facebook][27],
[YouTube][28], [Bandcamp][29], etc, etc. There are so friggin' many of
these friggin' things. All with their unique take on the future of
music.

I want a service to give me a tour of each of them. It's obviously a
little tongue-in-cheek. But also super useful (both for we people trying
to navigate all of these, and as a commentary (DO WE REALLY NEED THIS
MANY WHY ARE THEY STILL GETTING VC FUNDING)). Tell me if it's a
music-exploration service, or a place where I store my music, or both,
and how do bands post their own music, and how do fans navigate it, and
how are artists compensated, and how does the company make money. All of
this information and more could be crowd-sourced. Heck, maybe you could
even parse Wikipedia to get started. And a simple directory of all of
this information would be a great place to start, but I think the
biggest value would be in a browser extension that brought me to each
new service with a simple click. And a thumbs-up and thumbs-down button
for each service.
